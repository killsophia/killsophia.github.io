**其中两句歌词大爱：
Celebrate me for who I am,Dislike me for what I ain't.
Sticks and stones will break my bones,But your names will never hurt...**

专辑：Confessions On A Dance Floor
歌词：
You can call me a sinner,
Or you can call me a saint.
Celebrate me for who I am,
Dislike me for what I ain't.
Put me up on a pedestal,
Or drag me down in the dirt.
Sticks and stones will break my bones,
But your names will never hurt...

I'll be the garden, you'll be the snake,
All of my fruit is yours to take.
Better the devil that you know,
Your love for me will grow,
Because,

This is who I am.
You can like it or not.
You can love me or leave me.
'Cause I'm never gonna stop (No no).

Cleopatra had her way,
Matahari too.
Whether they were good or bad,
Is strictly up to you.
Life is a paradox,
And it doesn't make much sense.
Can't have the femme without the fatale.
Please don't take offense.

Don't let the fruit rot under the vine,
Fill up your cup and let's drink the wine.
Better the devil that you know,
Your love for me will grow,
Because,

This is who I am.
You can like it or not.
You can love me or leave me,
'Cause I'm never gonna stop (No no, you know).
This is who I am.
You can like it or not.
You can love me or leave me,
'Cause I'm never gonna stop (No no, you know).

No no, you know.
No no, you know.
No no, you know.
No no, you know.

I'll be the garden, you'll be the snake,
All of my fruit is yours to take.
Better the devil that you know,
Your love for me will grow,
Because,

This is who I am.
You can like it or not.
You can love me or leave me,
'Cause I'm never gonna stop (No no, you know).
This is who I am.
You can like it or not.
You can love me or leave me,
'Cause I'm never gonna stop (No no, you know).

No no, you know.
No no, you know.
No no, you know.
No no, you know.
