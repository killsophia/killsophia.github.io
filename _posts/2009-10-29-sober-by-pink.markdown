首先说一点关于这首歌的小故事。最早Funhose这张专辑注意到的不是这首，而是So what和Please don't leave me。但是在MTV颁奖仪式上看了Pink吊在半空中唱这首歌，颇觉耐人寻味。
Sober，形容词，意为“清醒的”。柯林斯中解释的很简单，not drunk。但是这首歌却不那么简单。
网上这首歌的中文歌词普遍都是机器翻译版本，生硬且有很多错误。突发奇想，召集几位网友想把歌词翻译出来，但是以失败告终。主要是在第一段就被搞得昏头涨脑了。其实仔细看来，英文歌词很直白，也比较口语化，但是要翻译成通顺且贴切的中文就比较困难了。虽然我能明白这首歌的意思，却无法用中文传达，一大憾事。

I don't wanna be the girl
Who laughs the loudest
Or the girl who never
Wants to be alone
I don't wanna be that call
At 4 o'clock in the morning
'cause I'm the only one you know
In the world that won't be home

Ahh, the sun is blinding
I stayed up again
Oohh, I am finding
That's not the way I want my story to end

I'm safe up high
Nothing can touch me
But why do I feel this party's over?
No pain inside
You're like protection
How do I feel this good sober?

I don't wanna be the girl
Who has to fill the silence
Crying scares me
Cause it screams the truth
Please don't tell me that
We had that conversation
I won't remember, save your breath
'cause what's the use?

Ahh, the night is calling
And it whispers to me softly,
"Come and play"
Ahh, I am falling
And if I let myself go
I'm the only one to blame

I'm safe up high
Nothing can touch me
But why do I feel this party's over?
No pain inside
You're like perfection
How do I feel this good sober?

I'm coming down, coming down, coming down
Spinning 'round, spinning 'round, spinning 'round
Looking for myself, sober
I'm coming down, coming down, coming down
Spinning 'round, spinning 'round, spinning 'round
Looking for myself, sober

When it's good, then it's good
It's so good till it goes bad
Till you're trying to find
The you that you once had
I have heard myself cry, "Never again"
Broken down in agony
Just trying to find a friend

I'm safe up high
Nothing can touch me
But why do I feel this party's over?
No pain inside
You're like perfection
How do I feel this good sober

I'm safe up high
Nothing can touch me
But why do I feel this party's over?
No pain inside
You're like perfection
How do I feel this good sober?

Will I ever feel this good sober?
Tell me, No no no no no pain
How do i feel this good sober?
