[Madonna-To have and not to hold](http://61.128.196.146:8787/download/ringmp3/2008/9/9/1510324162381.mp3)
[/coolplayer]

To have and not to hold

So hot, yet so cold

My heart is in your hand

And yet you never stand

Close enough for me to have my way

To love but not to keep

To laugh, not to weep

Your eyes, they go right through

And yet you never do

Anything to make me want to stay

Chorus:

Like a moth to a flame

Only I am to blame

Ba ba da ba ba ba

What can I do?

Ba ba da ba ba ba

I go straight to you

Ba ba da ba ba ba

I've been told

You're to have, not to hold

To look but not to see

To kiss but never be

The object of your desire

I'm walking on a wire

And there's no one at all

To break my fall

(chorus)

You're to have, not to hold

You're to have, not to hold

(chorus)

You're to have, not to hold

You're to have, not to hold

You're to have, not to hold

To break my heart 

                                                        

通常推荐Madonna的歌我是不废话的，不过这次还是忍不住废话一下。

这首歌并非Ray of light中我最喜爱的歌（最喜爱的是Frozen），但却是对我影响极深的歌。 甚至我可以开单曲重放不停地反复听。这是一首同样使我感到浑身寒冷的歌，相当醒神并且相当引人深思。很难去形容，仿佛飘在半空的嗓音和宛若叹息般的音乐，一声一声都敲打在心上，深入骨髓的寒冷。

不多说了，听吧。
