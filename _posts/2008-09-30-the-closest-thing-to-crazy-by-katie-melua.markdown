The Closest Thing To Crazy 

How can I think I'm standing strong? 

Yet feel the air beneath my feet. 

How can happiness feel so wrong? 

How can misery feel so sweet? 

How can you let me watch you sleep? 

Then break my dreams the way you do. 

How can I have got in so deep? 

Why did i fall in love with you? 

[Chorus]

This is the closest thing to crazy 

I have ever been. 

Feeling twenty-two, acting seventeen. 

This is the nearest thing to crazy 

I have ever known. 

But I was never crazy on my own. 

And now I know 

That there's a link between the two, 

Being close to craziness, and being close to you 

How can you let me fall apart? 

Then break my fall with lovin lies. 

It's so easy to break a heart, 

It's so easy to close your eyes. 

How can you treat me like a child? 

Yet like a child I yearn for you. 

How can anyone feel so wild? 

How ca anyone feel so blue? 

[Chorus]

This is the closest thing to crazy 

I have ever been. 

Feeling twenty-two, acting seventeen. 

This is the nearest thing to crazy 

I have ever known. 

I was never crazy on my own. 

And now I know 

That there's a link between the two, 

Being close to craziness, and being close to you 

And being close to you 

And being close to you
