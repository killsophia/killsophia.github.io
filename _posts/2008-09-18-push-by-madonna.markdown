[](http://www.51lrc.com/asp/lrc.asp?id=20051107eDCkHB)madonna - push (confessions on a dance floor)


you push me to go the extra mile
you push me when it's difficult to smile
you push me, a better version of myself
you push me, only you and no one else
you push me to see the other point of view
you push me when there's nothing else to do
you push me when i think i know it all
you push me when i stumble and i fall

keep on pushin' like nobody

every place i live, every mood i'm in
everything i do, i owe it all to you
every move i make, every step i take
every thing i know, it's all because you push me

you push me when i don't appreciate
you push me not to lie and not to hate
you push me when i want it all to end
you push me when i really need a friend
you push me, all i wanna do is cry
you push me when it's time for me to try
you push me when i do it for myself
you push me, only you and no one else

keep on pushin' like nobody

every place i live, every mood i'm in
everything i do, i owe it all to you
every move i make, every step i take
every thing i do, it's all because you push me

you push me

keep on pushin' like nobody
keep on, keep on

every place i live (to go the extra mile)
every mood i'm in (when it's difficult to smile)
everything i do (a better version of myself)
(only you and only you and only you)
every move i make (to see the other point of view)
every step i take (when there's nothing else to do)
every thing i do (i think i know it all)
(only you and only you and only you)
every place i live (to go the extra mile)
every mood i'm in (when it's difficult to smile)
everything i do (a better version of myself)
i owe it all to you (only you and only you and only you)
every move i make (to see the other point of view)
every step i take (when there's nothing else to do)
every thing i do (i think i know it all)
it's all because you push me

you push me
